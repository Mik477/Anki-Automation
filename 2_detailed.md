**Objective:**
Phase 2: Content Analysis & Blueprint Generation. Your task is to analyze the provided lecture materials for **[Insert Course Name] - Lecture [Insert Lecture Number or Topic]** and create a detailed "Anki Blueprint." This blueprint will serve as the strategic plan for the Anki cards you will generate later.

**Provided Materials:**
You are being given access to two files:
1.  **Lecture Slides** 

Your analysis should primarily focus on the slides, as they represent the core, examinable structure of the lecture. Use the transcript as a supplementary resource to identify crucial explanations, examples, or nuances mentioned by the professor that are not explicitly detailed on the slides.

### **Blueprint Requirements**

Generate a structured and comprehensive list that outlines all the key information from this lecture that needs to be converted into Anki cards. This is a plan, so **do not** generate the final card content yet.

**Structure for each item in the Blueprint:**

1.  **Topic/Concept Headline:** A clear and concise title for the information block (e.g., "Definition of SaaS," "Porter's Five Forces," "Transaction vs. Transformation Systems").
2.  **Source Reference:** Crucially, you must cite the exact slide number(s) where this information is located. Use the format `(VL [Lecture Number] Slide X-Y)`. If a vital piece of information comes *only* from the transcript, reference it with a short, searchable quote: `(Transcript: "As I mentioned, the key differentiator here is...")`.
3.  **Content Sketch & Rationale:** Briefly describe the core information to be captured. What is the key takeaway? Is it a definition, a process, a comparison, a list? This justifies why it's important for the exam.
4.  **Recommended Card Count:** Provide an estimated number of distinct Anki cards required to cover this topic thoroughly. Present this as `(Recommended Cards: N)`. A single complex slide might require multiple cards to break down its components effectively.

### **Example of a Perfect Blueprint Output:**

Here is a fictional example for a lecture on "E-Commerce Business Models":

**Anki Blueprint: Management der Informationssysteme (VL 2: Gesch√§ftsmodelle im E-Commerce)**

*   **1. Definition and Core Components of a Business Model**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 4-5)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** The blueprint should capture the formal definition of a business model and its three main components (Value Proposition, Value Creation, Ertragsmodell). It's a foundational concept.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 4 (One for the main definition, and one for each of the three components).

*   **2. Business-to-Consumer (B2C) E-Commerce Models**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 8)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** Focus on the direct-to-consumer nature. The key is understanding the relationship and examples.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 2 (One for the definition/characteristics, one for classic examples like Amazon or Zalando).

*   **3. The Long-Tail-Strategie**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 12-14)` & `(Transcript: "The crucial insight from Chris Anderson was that the cumulative profit from niche products...")`
    *   **Content Sketch:** This requires multiple cards. One for the core concept (selling a large number of unique items in small quantities), one for the graphical representation (the shape of the curve), and one for the necessary preconditions (e.g., centralized warehousing, low distribution costs). The professor's quote emphasizes the profit aspect, which is key.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 3

*   **4. Acronym: SaaS**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 18)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** Simple two-way card for the acronym and its full name.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 1 (This will be a "Basic (and reversed card)").

**Final Instruction:**
Please analyze the provided slides and transcript for **[Insert Lecture Number or Topic again]** and generate the Anki Blueprint following the exact structure and requirements detailed above. I will review the blueprint and then give you the command to proceed with generating the actual cards.
