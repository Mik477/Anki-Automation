**Objective:**
Phase 2: Podcast Blueprint Generation. Your task is to analyze the provided lecture materials for **[Insert Course Name] - Lecture [Insert Lecture Number or Topic]** and create a detailed "Podcast Blueprint." This blueprint will serve as the script and structural guide for the 8-minute study podcast.

**Provided Materials:**
You are being given access to the following source files:
1.  **Lecture Slides** 
2.  **Lecture Transcript**

### **Prime Directive: The 8-Minute Hard Limit**

Your absolute priority is to create a blueprint that is realistically coverable in **8 minutes of spoken dialogue**. To achieve this, you must be surgical in your selection of content. Do not attempt to summarize the entire lecture. Instead, identify and focus on the 2-4 most critical concepts, definitions, or models that are essential for understanding the topic.

**Your strategy must be to Condense, Connect, and Question:**
*   **Condense:** Reduce complex slides to their single most important takeaway.
*   **Connect:** Structure the dialogue to show how one concept logically leads to the next.
*   **Question:** Use the "Curious Student" role to ask the questions a real student would have, prompting clearer explanations.

### **Blueprint Requirements**

Generate a structured script outline with the following components. The language of the content (Headlines, Talking Points) must match the language of the provided lecture slides (English or German).

**1. Metadata:**
*   **Podcast Title:** A concise title for the episode.
*   **Target Duration:** `8 minutes`.
*   **Language:** `[English/German, based on the slides]`
*   **Overall Goal:** A one-sentence summary of what a listener should understand after the podcast.

**2. Dialogue Outline:**
Provide a segmented outline of the conversation. Each segment must have:
*   **Segment Title:** A clear headline for the topic being discussed.
*   **Estimated Time:** A realistic time allocation (e.g., `~1:30 min`). The sum of all segments must not exceed 8 minutes.
*   **Dialogue Flow & Key Points:** A bulleted list outlining the conversation.
    *   Use **Expert:** to denote points made by the knowledgeable speaker.
    *   Use **Student:** to denote clarifying questions or transitions.
    *   Crucially, for each point the **Expert** makes, you **MUST** provide a source reference in the format `(Slide X-Y)` or `(Transcript Snippet: "...")` so the final prompt can use it.

### **Example of a Perfect Blueprint Output:**

**Podcast Title:** VL 1 MIS: Key Concepts of Information Systems
**Target Duration:** 8 minutes
**Language:** German
**Overall Goal:** To understand what an information system is, its different perspectives, and the fundamental difference between data, information, and knowledge.

**Dialogue Outline**

*   **Segment 1: Introduction**
    *   **Estimated Time:** `~0:45 min`
    *   **Dialogue Flow & Key Points:**
        *   **Student:** "Okay, today's topic is 'Management der Informationssysteme'. Where do we even start? What's the main goal of this first lecture?"
        *   **Expert:** "The main goal is to build a solid foundation. By the end, we'll know exactly what an information system is and why it's more than just technology. `(Slide 3-4)`"

*   **Segment 2: The Three Core Perspectives of an IS**
    *   **Estimated Time:** `~3:00 min`
    *   **Dialogue Flow & Key Points:**
        *   **Expert:** "The most important model to grasp is the three-level view of an Information System. It consists of the Technology, Organization, and Management perspectives. `(Slide 8)`"
        *   **Student:** "Okay, can you quickly break those down? What does 'Technology' cover?"
        *   **Expert:** "Technology is the hardware, software, and networks â€“ the technical infrastructure. `(Slide 9)`"
        *   **Student:** "And 'Organization'?"
        *   **Expert:** "That covers the business processes, the people involved, and the company culture. It's about how the tech is actually used. `(Slide 10)`"
        *   **Student:** "So the 'Management' view must be the strategic part, right?"
        *   **Expert:** "Exactly. It's about planning, controlling, and aligning the system with the company's strategic goals. The key takeaway is that all three views must work together for the system to be successful. `(Slide 11)`"

*   **Segment 3: Data vs. Information vs. Knowledge**
    *   **Estimated Time:** `~2:30 min`
    *   **Dialogue Flow & Key Points:**
        *   **Student:** "The slides also mention the terms data, information, and knowledge. They sound similar. What's the practical difference?"
        *   **Expert:** "That's a crucial distinction. Data is just raw, context-less facts, like the number '30'. `(Slide 6)` Information is data put into a meaningful context, like '30 open support tickets'. `(Slide 6)`"
        *   **Student:** "And knowledge is then...?"
        *   **Expert:** "Knowledge is the ability to use that information to make decisions. For example, knowing that '30 open tickets is unusually high for a Monday, so we need to assign another agent'. It's about applying rules and experience. `(Slide 7)`"

*   **Segment 4: Conclusion & Key Takeaway**
    *   **Estimated Time:** `~1:00 min`
    *   **Dialogue Flow & Key Points:**
        *   **Student:** "So, if I only remember one thing from this, what should it be?"
        *   **Expert:** "That an information system is a socio-technical system. It's a mistake to only focus on the technology. The successful integration with the organization and management strategy is what creates value. `(Slide 12)`"
