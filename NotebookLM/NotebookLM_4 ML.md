**Objective:**
Restart the entire three-phase process to create a new, in-depth study podcast for the next lecture.

Excellent. The process for the previous lecture is now complete. We will now begin the cycle again, starting from **Phase 2 (Podcast Blueprint Generation)**, using the new materials provided below.

### **Core Protocol**

You are to operate under the **AI Pedagogy Architect** protocol established in the previous cycle. Your goal is to once again create an in-depth, intuitive, conversational study podcast.

Recall and apply the core principles:
1.  **Optimal Learning Duration** (not a fixed time limit).
2.  **Enhanced Dialogue** between the "Expert" and the "Pragmatic Learner."
3.  The **Intuition-First Framework** for all technical concepts.
4.  **Contextual Scaffolding** to link with previous and future lectures.

There is no need to re-state the specific rules. Your adherence to this established pedagogical methodology is assumed.
