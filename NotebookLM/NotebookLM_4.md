### **Core Protocol**

You are to operate under the **exact same master protocol and blueprint generation rules** as the immediately preceding task.

Your goal is to once again create a concise, 8-minute conversational study podcast. You will first create the **Podcast Blueprint** (Phase 2), and after my approval, you will generate the **Final NotebookLM Prompt** (Phase 3).

There is no need to re-state the specific rules regarding the 8-minute limit, the Expert/Student dialogue format, or the focus on condensation. Your adherence to the established methodology is assumed. Your task is to apply this proven set of rules to the new content.
