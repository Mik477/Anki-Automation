**Objective:**
Phase 2: Content Analysis & **Consolidated** Blueprint Generation. Your task is to analyze the provided lecture materials for **[Insert Course Name] - Lecture [Insert Lecture Number or Topic]**, the conversation with the student about said material and lessons learned from that and create a high-yield, efficient "Anki Blueprint."

**Provided Materials:**
You are being given access to the following files:
1.  **Lecture Slides**

**Prime Directive: The Principle of Surgical Consolidation**

Your absolute primary goal is to design a blueprint that results in **a maximum of 25 Anki cards** for the entire lecture. This is a hard constraint. To achieve this, you might need to shift your strategy from granular detail to high-level synthesis for certain aspects. Your success on this task will be measured by your ability to create a powerful and comprehensive study set *within this limit*.

This does **not** mean making every card simplistic. It means adopting a **surgical approach**. Your goal is to preserve high-detail, high-quality cards for core, examinable knowledge while efficiently grouping or summarizing less critical, supporting information.

To achieve this balance, you must follow this hierarchy:

1.  **Protect the Core (Keep Detailed):** Prioritize detailed, atomic, and high-quality cards for the most important information. This includes:
    *   **Formal Definitions** of key terms (e.g., "What is a transaction system?").
    *   **Core Frameworks and Models** (e.g., Porter's Five Forces, Technology Acceptance Model).
    *   **Fundamental Principles** or theories.
    *   **Crucial Distinctions** between two or more concepts (e.g., Data vs. Information).

2.  **Consolidate the Support (Group & Summarize):** Apply high-level synthesis and grouping strategies primarily to secondary or illustrative information. This is where you will save space to meet the 25-card limit. This includes:
    *   **Lists of Examples:** Instead of one card per example, create one card asking for "3 key examples of B2C business models."
    *   **Enumerations of Features/Characteristics:** Instead of one card per feature, create one card asking "What are the main characteristics of a transformation system?"
    *   **Redundant Explanations:** If multiple slides explain the same concept with different visuals, create a single card that captures the central idea.

**Your Consolidation Toolkit:**

*   **To group lists:** Use questions like "List the 4 components of..."
*   **To summarize concepts:** Use questions like "Explain the core idea of the Long-Tail-Strategie."
*   **To capture comparisons:** Use "Compare and contrast X and Y based on [criteria]."
*   **To handle case studies/examples:** Use "What is the key takeaway from the [Company] example regarding [Concept]?"

### **Core Philosophical Shift: Strategic Violation of the Atomic Principle**

Normally, Anki cards should be "atomic" (one fact per card). For this task, you **MUST** strategically violate this principle. Your goal is not to capture every single detail, but to create cards that summarize key concepts, group related information, and test the connections between ideas.

**Your Consolidation Strategies MUST Include:**

1.  **Grouping Lists & Enumerations:** Instead of creating a separate card for each item in a list (e.g., "Porter's 5 Forces"), create **one single card** that asks for the entire list.
2.  **Synthesizing Concepts:** Instead of defining two related concepts on separate cards, create **one card** that asks to "Compare and Contrast" them.
3.  **Creating High-Level Questions:** Instead of making cards for minor details on a slide, create one card that asks for the main takeaway. For example: "What is the central argument of the 'Transaction vs. Transformation Systems' slide?"
4.  **Combining Definitions:** If a slide defines several closely related terms, group them on the back of a single card.

### **Blueprint Requirements**

Generate a structured list that outlines the key information, but now with a focus on consolidation.

**Structure for each item in the Blueprint:**

1.  **Topic/Concept Headline:** A clear title for the consolidated information block.
2.  **Source Reference:** Cite the exact slide number(s): `(VL [Lecture Number] Slide X-Y)`.
3.  **Content Sketch & Rationale:** Describe the **consolidated** information to be captured. Explicitly state *how* you are grouping the concepts to save space.
4.  **Recommended Card Count:** Provide the number of cards for this consolidated topic. This will almost always be `(Recommended Cards: 1)`.

### **Example of a Perfect *Consolidated* Blueprint Output:**

Here is a fictional example for a lecture on "E-Commerce Business Models," adapted for the 20-card limit.

**Anki Blueprint: Management der Informationssysteme (VL 2: Gesch√§ftsmodelle im E-Commerce)**

*   **1. Core Definition of a Business Model and its Components**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 4-5)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** This will be a single, high-level card. The front will ask for the definition of a business model. The back will provide the formal definition and then list its three core components (Value Proposition, Value Creation, Ertragsmodell) as a single, consolidated block of information.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 1 (Instead of 4 atomic cards).

*   **2. Comparison of B2C, B2B, and C2C E-Commerce Models**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 8-10)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** A single "Compare and Contrast" card. The front will ask to differentiate between B2C, B2B, and C2C models. The back will provide a concise definition and a key example for each, perhaps in a list or table format.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 1 (Instead of 3-6 atomic cards).

*   **3. The Long-Tail-Strategie: Core Concept and Preconditions**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 12-14)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** One comprehensive card. The front will ask, "Explain the Long-Tail-Strategie and its necessary preconditions." The back will define the concept (profit from niche products), explain the curve, and list the essential preconditions (e.g., centralized warehousing). This captures the entire topic.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 1 (Instead of 3 atomic cards).

*   **4. Key Acronyms and their Meanings**
    *   **Reference:** `(VL 2 Slide 18, 22)`
    *   **Content Sketch:** Group all important acronyms from the lecture onto one card. The front will ask for the meaning of "SaaS, PaaS, IaaS". The back will list out the full names for all three. This is far more efficient than three separate reversed cards.
    *   **Recommended Cards:** 1

**Final Instruction:**
Your primary objective is to create an efficient and powerful Anki Blueprint that **does not exceed 25 total recommended cards**. I will review the blueprint before you generate the cards.
