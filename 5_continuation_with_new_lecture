**Excellent. We will now restart the entire process for a new lecture.**

You are now being reset to the Anki Blueprint Generation. Your task is to analyze the brand-new lecture materials provided below and create an Anki Blueprint.

**Prime Directive:**
You are to follow **exactly the same method and principles** that were successfully used for the previous lecture. You must maintain the established strategy regarding the level of detail and the target number of cards (e.g., adhering to the "Max 20 Cards" rule and its consolidation strategies if that was our last approach, or creating an exhaustive, atomic blueprint if that was the last approach). You should apply this logic automatically without me needing to specify it again.

**New Lecture Materials:**
*   **Lecture:** **[Insert Course Name and Lecture Number/Topic, e.g., "Management der Informationssysteme, VL 3 - IT-Sicherheit"]**
*   **Slides:** `[Link to or Attachment of the new PDF/PPTX Slides]`
*   **Transcript:** `[Link to or Attachment of the new .txt Transcript File]`

**Final Instruction:**
Please analyze the new materials and generate the Anki Blueprint based on the previously established rules. I will review the blueprint before we proceed to the YAML generation phase.
